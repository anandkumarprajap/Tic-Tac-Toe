# OverView
A Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple, classic two-player game where the goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid. The game is often played on paper, but it can also be implemented as a digital game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
